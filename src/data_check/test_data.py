    This test will pass if the DataFrame `data` has all of the expected columns in the correct

    specified sequence, as downstream data processing and analysis may depend on this structure.

    Parameters:
    - data: A pandas DataFrame containing the dataset to be tested.

    Test to ensure the 'neighbourhood_group' column contains only known neighborhood names.

    This test checks that the values in the 'neighbourhood_group' column of the DataFrame `data`
    match a predefined set of known neighborhood names. The test is unordered, meaning that the
    values must match, but the order in which they appear does not matter. This can be used to
    validate data integrity, especially after merging or joining datasets that could introduce
    new, unexpected categories.

    Parameters:

    Parameters:
